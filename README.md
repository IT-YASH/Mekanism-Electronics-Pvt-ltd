I have pushed the partially completed project because building the full version would take more time. I have already fetched the Pokémon data from the backend using the getAllPokemon API, but I faced some issues while passing the data into the component. The frontend UI is mostly completed, and the basic structure is working. Pagination is still pending, and I haven’t worked much on the search bar and sorting features yet, although I understand the basic flow of how they will work. I will continue implementing these parts in the next steps.
